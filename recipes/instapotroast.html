        <ul>
            <li>4 lbs., beef chuck roast</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs, thyme and rosemary</li>
            <li>Mushrooms</li>
            <li>4 cloves, garlic</li>
            <li>1 Cup, beef broth</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Let meat come to room temperature - about a couple hours on the counter.</li>
            <li>With the meat patted dry, season all sides with salt and pepper</li>
            <li>In a preheated saute pan with a little olive oil, sear all sides of the meat.</li>
            <li>Place meat in an InstaPot.  Place lid on and make sure sealing valve is in the correct position.  With the manual setting engaged, set the time for 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>When timer goes off, release the pressure valve.</li>
            <li>Remove meat from the InstaPot, and set aside to rest for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy on top of cauliflower puree with a complex, yet approachable red wine of your choosing, preferably on the dry side, though fruit forward varieties - read: Southern Californian Pinot's - will go nicely with this dish.  Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
